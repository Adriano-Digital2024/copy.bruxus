## Why CopyMonster?

Most AI copy tools are closed black boxes that don't know your brand. You paste a prompt, get generic output, and tweak it forever.

**CopyMonster takes the opposite path:** you cannot generate a single line of copy until your 12-block Brand DNA is mapped. Every agent — Hook, Headline, VSL, Email, Ads — reads from that DNA.

The result? Copy that sounds like your brand, because the strategy was defined **before** the words.

- 🧬 **Brand DNA first** — 12 structured blocks (6 structural, 6 adaptive), versioned like code.
- 🤖 **Multi-agent system** — specialist agents, each with its own prompt, model, and few-shots.
- 📊 **Meta Ads loop** — connect Meta Ads & Instagram and feed real performance back into the DNA.

## DNA First — the core of CopyMonster

CopyMonster is built around a single, opinionated rule:

> **No DNA → no copy.**

When a user signs up, the app guides them through the **12-block Brand DNA**
before any agent is unlocked. Each block captures a strategic dimension of
the brand (voice, audience, offer, mechanism, objections, proof, etc.).
The DNA is versioned, comparable, and re-usable across every agent.

| Layer | Blocks | Editable by |
|---|---|---|
| **Structural** | Voice, Audience, Offer, Mechanism, Promise, Positioning | Human (locked once approved) |
| **Adaptive**   | Hooks, Objections, Proofs, Angles, CTAs, Tone shifts | Human in Core · AI in Enterprise |

In the **Core**, the user updates the adaptive layer manually.
In **Enterprise**, the **DNA Intelligence Engine** evolves it automatically
from real Meta Ads performance (ROAS, CTR, hook retention, etc.).

This is the differentiator no other open-source or commercial tool ships
today.

2. Cloudflare Dashboard → Pages → **Connect to Git**.
3. Build settings:
   - Framework preset: **Vite**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Build output: `dist`
   - Node version: `18`
4. Environment variables (Production & Preview):
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`
   - `VITE_SUPABASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` _(optional)_
5. Add `public/_redirects` with `/*    /index.html   200` for SPA fallback.

## Supported LLM Providers

CopyMonster is **BYO LLM**. Configure providers via Supabase Edge Function
secrets (never in the committed `.env`).

| Provider | Status | Secret name |
|---|---|---|
| Lovable AI Gateway (default, proxies OpenAI/Anthropic/Google) | Wired | `LOVABLE_API_KEY` |
| OpenAI | Wired | `OPENAI_API_KEY` |
| Anthropic | Wired | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` |
| OpenRouter | Wired (default fallback) | `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` |
| Mistral | Wired | `MISTRAL_API_KEY` |
| Ollama (local / self-hosted) | Wired | `OLLAMA_BASE_URL` |

### Bring your own LLM

`chat-stream` and `agent-test` route requests based on the `model_id` prefix
configured in the admin **Models** page:

| Prefix on `model_id` | Provider | Example model id |
|---|---|---|
| `mistralai/` or `mistral/` | Mistral | `mistralai/mistral-large-latest` |
| `ollama/` | Ollama (self-hosted) | `ollama/llama3.1:8b` |
| _(anything else)_ | OpenRouter | `google/gemini-2.5-flash` |

To use a local Ollama server (self-hosters only), set the
`OLLAMA_BASE_URL` edge-function secret (e.g. `http://host.docker.internal:11434`
or your Ollama URL) and register a model row with an `ollama/…` id. All three
providers speak the OpenAI-compatible `/v1/chat/completions` streaming API, so
no client changes are needed.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md#adding-a-new-llm-provider) for the
integration contract.
